## Customization Ideas

Want to extend this analysis? Try:

1. **Filter by genre** - Analyze specific game categories
2. **Time series** - Deep dive into release trends
3. **Price modeling** - Predict optimal pricing
4. **Sentiment analysis** - Analyze review text (if available)
5. **Clustering** - Group similar games
6. **Recommendation system** - Build game recommendations

## Data Structure

The `steam_games.csv` contains:
- Game metadata (name, developer, publisher)
- Pricing information
- Review statistics
- Genre and category tags
- Platform availability
- Release dates
- Achievement counts
- And more...

## Visualizations Included

The notebook generates:
- üìä Bar charts and histograms

- üì¶ Box plots for statistics
- üé® Heatmaps for correlations
- üìç Scatter plots for relationships

All visualizations are:
- High quality and publication-ready
- Color-coded for clarity
- Labeled with values
- Grid-enhanced for readability

## Need Help?

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Can't install packages  
**Solution**: Try `pip3` instead of `pip` or use a virtual environment

**Issue**: Jupyter won't start  
**Solution**: Make sure you installed `jupyter` package: `pip install jupyter notebook`

**Issue**: Visualizations don't show  
**Solution**: In Jupyter, they should show inline. Check if `%matplotlib inline` is set.

## Next Steps

After exploring this analysis:

1. ‚úÖ Review the findings section for key insights
2. ‚úÖ Try modifying filters to focus on specific genres
3. ‚úÖ Add your own analysis questions
4. ‚úÖ Create new visualizations
5. ‚úÖ Share your findings!
